  - Create Scraper for CSV Data
  - Possibly work on data structure for how to run backend tasks involving class scheduling
  - Set up CSV (whether via CATS or manually)
  - Figure out more about render and how to work with it
  - Help with team website where necessary
 
- Tasks Completed:
  - Decision made on hosting. Use github pages for the team website and use render for the "DegreeAdmin" website
  - Team Github page is live
  - CSV file layout for course catalog/major minor requirements finalized
  - Updates to the github repository for deliverables and csv files for courses/majors/minors
